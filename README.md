# Tinypaste

Tiny public Markdown pastebin.

- Rendered Markdown, Mermaid as zoomable SVG, LaTeX math
- No account. No token.
- Works from any shell, script, or agent.
- Self-hosts free on Deno Deploy in under a minute.

Most paste tools are cluttered editing environments that require an account or token and don't render Markdown, Mermaid, and LaTeX all in one. This one is for quickly sharing: paste Markdown, get a short public URL, move on.

Example: https://tnypst.xyz/6XvGcED

## API

POST Markdown. The default response is the short URL.

```sh
curl -X POST https://tnypst.xyz/api/pastes \
  -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
  --data-binary '# hello'
```

```sh
curl -X POST https://tnypst.xyz/api/pastes \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -d '{"markdown":"# hello\n\n- one\n- two"}'
```

```sh
curl -X POST https://tnypst.xyz/api/pastes \
  -H "Content-Type: text/markdown" \
  --data-binary @README.md
```

## Self-host

You can deploy it on [Deno](https://deno.com/deploy) quickly:

1. Fork [this repo](https://github.com/martinopiaggi/tinypaste) and push it to GitHub.
2. Open https://console.deno.com.
3. Create an app from the GitHub repo.
4. Use this build config: no preset, dynamic runtime, entrypoint `main.js`, empty install and build command.
5. Provision a Deno KV database.
6. Assign that KV database to the app.

## Raycast
